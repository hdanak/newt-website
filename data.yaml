intro: Newt is a dynamic programming language with a focus on speed and utility. Newt is designed to run fast without having you micromanage low-level details, optimizing your code with information available at both compile-time and runtime. This decouples the expressiveness of the language from the mechanism you decide to use, i.e. dynamic typing or polymorphism. While Newt has support for object-oriented and functional programming, it doesn't try to force you into any single programming paradigm or style.

  # Hello World!
  say('Hello World!')

  my \$n = 3 * 2
  # Lists
  my @l = [1, 2, 3]
  # K-V Maps and Sets
  my %h = {a => 1, b => 2}
  print(%h.a) # or %h{a}
  my %s = {1, 2, 3..}

    Newt is a high-level programming language with a focus on speed and utility, both in development and runtime. Newt is designed with performance in mind, dismissing the idea that there must be a trade-off between speed and expressiveness. The modular Newt compiler is designed to target various back-ends, or even translate your code to other languages. Designed with TIMTOWTDI in mind, Newt doesn't try to force you into a single programming paradigm or style, and has built-in support for common programming styles such as functional and object-oriented programming.
